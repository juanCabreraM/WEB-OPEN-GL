Concept

The idea is to represent movement in time, you can control one dot
in space and create a trace in time corresponding leaving a marc of
dots and waves like water drops falling.

For that I create a grid of 3D objects and play with the scale of
them in order to create each dot and link the wave with the centre
of the static dots. The colour is based in the Bauhaus basic pantones. 

In order to control the movement I connect a remote control, in this
case use a phone, that remote control the movement of the dot by
tracing the touch position of the screen, additionally every time
you tap or click in the screen create a new static dot and trigger
the respective wave.
